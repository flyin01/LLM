      "## Prompt\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "You are an advanced AI agent designed to solve complex tasks by interacting with external tools. ...\n",
      "\n",
      "You can use the following tools:\n",
      "\n",
      "- search(query): returns top 3 relevant results from web\n",
      "- calculator(expr): returns the evaluated result of a mathematical expression\n",
      "- wikipedia(page_title): returns summary of a Wikipedia page\n",
      "- ... etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "When performing a task, you should produce a step-by-step plan, decide which tool to use and what query to pass. Each tool call should be output in a JSON format:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      " \"name\": \"search\",\n",
      " \"arguments\": {\"query\": \"Python programming language\"}\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "The system will execute the tool and return the result in a JSON object:\n",
      "\n",
      "{\n",
      " \"name\": \"search\",\n",
      " \"return\": [...],\n",
      " \"id\": \"some_id\"\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "You should then incorporate the returned data into your next steps until you can produce a final answer. Output should be human-readable final answer. ...\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the prompt could incorporate a template for a \"Reasoning\" and \"Action\" style.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to ensure it is \"optimal\" for gpt-oss:20b, a presumably large language model with some tool calling support.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to propose a prompt that instructs how to structure the conversation and tool calls. Possibly also specify that we should output the final answer only at the end, not intermediate steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also include guidelines to reduce hallucinations, such as \"only use tools if uncertain\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Also mention that we should handle tool responses, parse them, and incorporate into reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also we might include a \"tool call\" format that is used by the system to process calls: maybe something like:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "<tool_name> {\n",
      "  \"arguments\": {...}\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Or we can adopt the format used by the OpenAI Chat API for tool calling: each tool call is an \"assistant\" message with \"function_call\" property.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the context of \"gpt-oss:20b\", we don't know the specifics. Possibly the system expects the model to output a JSON representation of tool calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can propose a format that is simple and parseable: each tool call is a JSON object, with name and arguments. The system expects the model to produce a JSON string. The model will produce multiple JSON objects in a list, perhaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we can also propose a stepwise approach: \"Plan\" block, \"Action\" block, \"Observation\" block.\n",
      "\n",
      "We could propose a prompt like:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "You are a helpful AI assistant. Use the provided tools to accomplish tasks. Each tool call is specified as:\n",
      "\n",
      "{ \"name\": \"tool_name\", \"arguments\": {...} }\n",
      "\n",
      "The system will return the result as:\n",
      "\n",
      "{ \"name\": \"tool_name\", \"return\": ..., \"id\": \"...\" }\n",
      "\n",
      "Your task: respond with a plan, then tool calls as needed, and finally produce the final answer. Avoid hallucinations. \n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "We also want to emphasize that the model should think before calling tools, and not call too many. It should be as efficient as possible. Also, we might want to mention that the tool set can be extended.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the prompt we propose must be \"optimal\" meaning we need to incorporate best practices from OpenAI's guidance for building agentic LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can also incorporate a \"chain-of-thought\" prompting: Encourage the model to think step-by-step.\n",
      "\n",
      "We might also mention that the model should always produce an explicit \"Thought\" or \"Plan\" at the beginning.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can incorporate a skeleton:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "You are a smart agent. You can call the following tools: \n",
      "- ... \n",
      "You will output your plan, followed by tool calls. \n",
      "Each tool call should be a JSON object: {\"name\":\"tool\", \"arguments\":{...}} \n",
      "The system will respond with an \"Observation\" in JSON: {\"name\":\"tool\",\"return\":...} \n",
      "You will incorporate the observation and decide your next step. \n",
      "Continue until you can produce the final answer. \n",
      "The final answer must be plain text (no JSON).\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "We can also include example dialogues to illustrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should also include that the tool calls can be nested; but we can just keep it simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "We might also mention that the model should avoid unnecessary tool calls; it should confirm if the answer can be derived from existing knowledge. If uncertain, call a tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should also mention that the model should be mindful of token usage: keep plan concise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also mention \"Do not use the same tool multiple times with identical arguments unless needed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Also mention \"If tool call fails, produce an error message and try again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Also mention that the system might provide the tool name, arguments, and return.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the prompt can be designed such that the system will parse tool calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can include that the tool calls should be in separate assistant messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to produce the final answer in markdown format, so we need to produce the entire prompt in markdown. The user specifically says: \"The response should be in markdown format.\" So we need to produce a markdown-formatted prompt. So we can produce a markdown block with code fences for the prompt. Or we can produce the prompt in plain markdown text with code fences.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user didn't ask for a code block for the prompt. They said: \"Propose the optimal prompt for the gpt-oss:20b model. The prompt should be useful for agentic tasks with tool calling. The response should be in markdown format.\" So we need to produce a markdown response that includes the prompt we propose. So we should present the prompt in markdown format. Possibly we can use a code block, with a large prompt. For example:\n",

      "\n",
      "...\n",
      "\n",
      "````\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we can include the prompt inside triple backticks to preserve formatting. The user might want a prompt that can be copied and used.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to consider the prompt design: we need to ensure that the model knows the roles: \"You are an AI agent\" and the system message. But for the prompt we can include the system message. It might be used as the system prompt. The user might supply tasks to the assistant. The system message can include instructions to call tools, plan, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also we need to mention the \"function calling\" style: The system might use \"function calling\" and the model will output \"function calls\". So we might include a JSON schema for each tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can include a \"tools\" list and a \"tool schema\" that the model can use. But the prompt can be used as the system prompt in the conversation. So we can include the list of tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can adopt the format used in \"OpenAI tool calling\" examples, which includes the \"function\" definitions in the \"tools\" parameter. But we don't need to include them in the prompt; we can just instruct the model that it can call them. The system will parse them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the prompt can be something like:\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "You are an advanced AI system. Your job is to solve tasks that might require external tools. The following tools are available: {list}. You should plan your steps, decide which tool to call, format the call as JSON, get the tool's output, incorporate it, and produce a final answer. ...\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "We can also propose a template for the conversation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The user says the problem.\n",
      "2. The assistant (model) outputs a \"Plan\" block.\n",
      "3. The assistant then outputs a \"ToolCall\" block.\n",
      "4. The system returns the tool's result.\n",
      "5. The assistant processes the observation.\n",
      "6. The assistant continues until final.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can embed that structure in the prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prompt might also include some examples to illustrate how to call the tool. We can give a short example of a tool call and the observation.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also need to keep it succinct.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should also include guidelines on error handling: if the tool fails or returns error, the model should decide to retry or adjust query.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also need to instruct that the model should not hallucinate answers, but use tool if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also need to instruct that the final answer should be a natural language text.\n",
      "\n",
      "We might include some best practice guidelines: \"Always start with 'Plan:'\" etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also might need to mention the \"Stop\" tokens or \"End\" markers.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to keep the prompt in a format that the system can parse. The system might parse the prompt for a list of tools and a tool schema. But we can just give instructions.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. The user gives a request.\n",
      "2. You generate a short `Plan` outlining the necessary steps.\n",
      "3. For each step that requires data or action, you emit a tool call in the following JSON format:\n",
      "\n",
      "```json\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"name\": \"tool_name\",\n",
      "  \"arguments\": { ... }\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. You read the observation, update your internal state, and decide on the next step.\n",
      "6. Repeat steps 3–5 until you can provide a final answer.\n",
      "7. Output the final answer as plain text (no JSON), preceded by `Final Answer:`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Rules\n",
      "\n",
      "- Think step-by-step and always produce a `Plan` before any tool calls.\n",
      "- Use tools only when the answer is uncertain or requires up-to-date information.\n",
      "- Avoid hallucinating; if the tool fails, note the error and try a different query or tool.\n",
      "- Keep each plan step concise and focused.\n",
      "- Do not output any tool calls or internal reasoning after the final answer.\n",

      "- The outer triple backticks contain the entire prompt, but inside there's another code block for the system message. That may confuse a Markdown parser: the system message uses triple backticks too. But it's nested within triple backticks, but the inner triple backticks are inside the outer code block; in markdown, code blocks can't nest. But we are providing the entire prompt as code; it's okay to have triple backticks inside as code fences, but the inner triple backticks will not be interpreted by Markdown as code fences if inside a code block. Actually, if you put a triple backtick inside a code block, it will be rendered as literal text. But here, the outer triple backticks start the prompt, then they have a triple backtick block for the system message inside the prompt. In Markdown, you can't nest fences, but the inner fences are inside the outer code block, so they'll appear as plain text. But maybe it's okay, as it's part of the prompt content. But in practice, the system message is defined inside triple backticks, but as part of the prompt text. The system message is a plain string. It doesn't matter if it's in a code block in the prompt. But it's a bit confusing for humans reading the prompt: we might want to remove the inner code fences and just use a block quote or no formatting. But it's fine.\n",

      "Also, the prompt has a heading inside triple backticks for the system message. Actually, the outer triple backticks start the whole prompt, then inside there's a triple backtick for the system message content. That is nested. In Markdown, nested code blocks are not allowed. But it's inside a code block, so it's okay: it's just part of the code block. However, it's not necessary: we can simplify.\n",

      "\n",
      "Also, we might mention that the \"Tool Efficiency\" rule: call tool only if internal knowledge insufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "We might also mention that the system message instructs to \"Always produce a short, concise plan first before any tool calls.\" So we can add guidelines: limit plan to max 5 steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "We might also mention that the system message instructs to \"Keep plan in natural language, and only use JSON when issuing or receiving tool calls.\" So we need to enforce that the plan is not JSON. Good.\n",

      " We need to \"Improve the following prompt for the gpt-oss:20b model based on the evaluation.\" The prompt is the text between triple backticks. The evaluation is the text between triple tildes. We need to respond in markdown format. The task: improve the prompt. So we need to produce a revised prompt that addresses the weaknesses and implements the suggested improvements. Essentially produce an improved system message that meets the guidelines, using the evaluation's suggestions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to output a markdown formatted answer. The answer should contain the improved prompt. The improved prompt should incorporate improvements: no nested backticks, explicit Plan header, JSON schema, example fully formatted, no nested fences, use single backticks for inline code, add retry logic, confidence threshold, observation fields, plan length limit, track tool calls, support tool chaining, safety for execute_command, unique_id usage, maybe a glossary, version number. We also need to embed the entire improved prompt inside triple backticks as code block? But the prompt itself is the text between triple backticks, so likely we need to output the improved prompt inside triple backticks as a code block. The evaluation is separate; we might include it as context but not necessary. We just output the improved prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to respond in markdown. The instructions: \"Improve the following prompt for the gpt-oss:20b model based on the evaluation. The prompt is delimited by triple backticks. The evaluation is delimited by triple tildes. Respond in markdown format.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the output should be a markdown formatted answer. We can include headings like \"Revised System Prompt\" and then the prompt in a code block. Use no nested backticks inside the code block. Use single backticks for inline code.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to ensure that inside the prompt we don't use triple backticks. But we need to show JSON examples. We can show JSON using single backticks or indenting properly. But the system prompt can include JSON examples. In the original, they had triple backticks inside triple backticks. To avoid that, we can use single backticks to denote JSON or use code fences inside the prompt but using triple backticks might be okay if we put them as part of the prompt. But the evaluation pointed out that nested backticks cause confusion. So we should avoid nested fences inside the code block of the system prompt. Instead, we can use \"```json\" fences for JSON but inside the prompt's code block we cannot have triple backticks. So we should avoid triple backticks inside the system prompt. We can use single backticks to show JSON or indent JSON. Or we can use a block quote. But the evaluation suggests to avoid nested triple backticks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the improved prompt will be a code block containing the prompt. Within the prompt, JSON examples will be shown with indentation but without triple backticks. For example:\n",

      "```\n",
      "{\n",
      "  \"name\": \"search\",\n",
      "  \"arguments\": {\"query\": \"latest Bitcoin price\"},\n",
      "  \"id\": \"c1\"\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "We can show that. But we need to show the syntax for the tool call. The example can show the JSON code in the prompt but not in a triple backtick. We can use indentations. But indenting with 4 spaces will preserve code formatting in markdown. That is fine. But we need to avoid triple backticks inside the prompt. So we can use 4-space indents for JSON blocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also need to incorporate plan format, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to produce a revised system prompt that is more robust.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can incorporate the version, maybe \"Prompt‑v1.0.0\" or \"GPT-Oss:20b Agent Prompt v1.0.0\".\n",
      "\n",

      "We need to mention tool chaining: maybe \"If you need to chain multiple tools, you can send multiple tool calls sequentially; store results by id.\" Or \"For chaining, you can use sub-steps: 1. Call tool A, 2. Call tool B with output from A.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to mention adding new tools: if needed, send a request_add_tool JSON with tool name and description.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to include the plan size limit: max 5 steps, 256 tokens.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to include confidence threshold: internal confidence > 0.8 skip tool call.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to include retry logic: if status error or insufficient data, re-query or fallback.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to mention safety constraints: whitelist for execute_command.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to show a clear example: user asks for Bitcoin price. Assistant provides plan, tool call JSON, receives observation, updates plan, final answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to keep \"Final Answer:\" prefix and no JSON after.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to ensure the prompt does not use nested backticks.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can present the revised prompt in a code block in markdown. The code block will contain the entire system message. Within that code block, we will show JSON examples with indentation and no triple backticks. We will avoid nested triple backticks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, we might add a \"Glossary\" section in the prompt to explain terms. But not necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "We should maintain the same structure but improved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The output: a markdown answer with the revised system prompt. Maybe also mention the improvements.\n",

      "Better to just output the revised prompt. But the instruction: \"Improve the following prompt for the gpt-oss:20b model based on the evaluation. Respond in markdown format.\" So we should present the improved prompt as a code block. Maybe also explain the changes or just present the prompt. Usually they want the improved prompt. But we can also mention the changes in comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the prompt is part of the system message; we should just give the improved prompt. The improved prompt will be the content inside triple backticks. The rest is explanation. However, we might also want to include an explanation of the improvements, but the instruction didn't ask for an explanation; just \"Improve the following prompt\". We can just output the improved prompt. But the evaluation states \"Respond in markdown format\". So we can give a markdown formatted answer with the revised prompt in a code block. And maybe a short intro.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the answer: start with a heading: \"Revised GPT‑Oss:20b Agent Prompt\" and then a code block with the improved prompt. That is likely sufficient.\n",

The tool call is also part of the assistant's message. But the system may parse the JSON part. We need to instruct that the assistant should output the JSON call exactly, not wrapped in any text.

      "- **Avoid hallucination** – never fabricate information.  \n",
      "- **Confidence check** – if internal confidence > 0.8, skip tool calls.  \n",
      "- **Tool efficiency** – call a tool only when confidence ≤ 0.8.  \n",
      "- **Retry logic** – on `status: \"error\"` or insufficient data, re‑query or switch tools.  \n",
      "- **Safety (execute_command)** – allowed commands: `ls`, `cat`, `echo`. Any other command is disallowed.  \n",
      "- **No redundancy** – do not repeat the same tool call with identical arguments.  \n",
      "- **Unique ID usage** – store each tool response keyed by its `id` for future reference.  \n",
      "- **Adding tools** – if a required tool is missing, request it with:\n",
